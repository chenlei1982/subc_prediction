# subc_prediction
Identification of protein subcellular locations is an important problem in protein science. Novel prediction models are proposed to identify human protein subcellular locations. These models adopt new protein features, which are derived from protein-protein interaction network, gene ontology terms and KEGG pathways. The models with these features provide good performance and are superior to classic models with pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC) features.
